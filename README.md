# Customer Segmentation for Retail

## Project Overview

To effectively segment customers based on their purchasing behavior in order to gain insights into their preferences, thereby improving marketing strategies.

## Data Sources

This dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail

## Tools Used for this project

This analysis utilized the following Python libraries: 
- NumPy for numerical operations
-  Pandas for data processing
-  Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
-  Scikit-learn provides the algorithms for the clustering task and they includes: KMeans, DBSCAN, MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler, silhouette_score, TSNE, and PCA)

## Data Cleaning/Preparation

Missing values were detected and filled proportionally

## Analysis of Customer Segmentation 

### RFM Analysis

RFM Metrics Calculation:
- Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) metrics were calculated for each customer
- Recency was determined as the number of days since the customer's last purchase
- Frequency was calculated as the total number of purchases made by the customer
- Monetary value was calculated as the total amount spent by each customer

Data Normalization:
- To ensure that the clustering algorithm was not biased by features with different scales, the RFM metrics were normalized using Min-Max scaling. This scaled the data to a range between 0 and 1

### K-Means Clustering

- Customer Segmentation: K-Means clustering was applied to segment customers based on their RFM characteristics.
- Determining Optimal Number of Clusters: The optimal number of clusters (k) was determined using the Elbow Method and Silhouette analysis.
  - The Elbow Method identified the point of diminishing returns in the relationship between the number of clusters and the within-cluster sum of squares (inertia)
  - The Silhouette analysis evaluated the quality of cluster assignments by measuring how well each data point was assigned to its cluster compared to other clusters
- Cluster Assignment: Customers were assigned to clusters based on their similarity to other customers within the cluster


The approach above has effectively segmented customers based on their purchasing behavior, providing valuable insights for targeted marketing and customer relationship management strategies.


## Visualizations

- Elbow Method: A visual representation of the Elbow Method was generated by plotting the within-cluster sum of squares (inertia) against the number of clusters (k). The "elbow" point in the plot, where the rate of decrease in inertia begins to diminish significantly, indicates the optimal number of clusters.
- Silhouette Analysis: A plot of the Silhouette Score against the number of clusters was generated. Higher Silhouette Scores generally indicate better-defined and more distinct clusters.

# 
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA was applied to reduce the dimensionality of the data from three dimensions (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to two dimensions. This allowed for a 2D visualization of customer segments using a scatter plot, where each point represents a customer and is color-coded based on its assigned cluster.

# 
- t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE): t-SNE was used to further enhance the visualization by creating a 3D representation of the customer segments. This 3D visualization provides a more nuanced view of the clustering structure, allowing for a better understanding of the relationships between customer segments.

# Results and Recommendations

### **Marketing Strategies for Customer Segments**
**Loyal Customers (Cluster 0)**  
  **RFM Values:** **`Recency`**: 73 Days, **`Frequency`**: 54.75, **`Monetary`**: ≈ 1,006  
  Customers in this segment have made frequent purchases in the past and are highly engaged. To maintain their loyalty, **Loyalty Programs** should be implemented, offering exclusive rewards or discounts for repeat purchases. Personalized content such as VIP offers or special birthday/anniversary deals can further enhance engagement.

**Dormant Customers (Cluster 1)**  
  **RFM Values:** **`Recency`**: 260 Days, **`Frequency`**: 23.65, **`Monetary`**: ≈ 476  
  Customers who have not engaged with the brand for a while are in this segment. **Re-engagement Campaigns** are ideal, including personalized reactivation emails or SMS with special offers. Discounts or promotions can be provided to reignite their interest and bring them back into the funnel.

**Moderately Engaged (Cluster 2)**  
  **RFM Values:** **`Recency`**: 129 Days, **`Frequency`**: 45.22, **`Monetary`**: ≈ 761  
  These customers are somewhat active, but not as frequently as loyal customers. **Product Recommendations** based on their previous behavior can encourage them to engage more. Time-sensitive offers can also be used to increase purchase frequency and boost their overall engagement.

**Very Inactive Customers (Cluster 3)**  
  **RFM Values:** **`Recency`**: 338 Days, **`Frequency`**: 23.33, **`Monetary`**: ≈ 322  
  These customers are the least engaged, having a long time since their last purchase. **Targeted Promotions** should be used to reach them, offering deep discounts or limited-time offers to attract attention. It’s also beneficial to send a survey or request feedback to understand their inactivity and potentially win them back.

**Occasional Shoppers (Cluster 4)**  
  **RFM Values:** **`Recency`**: 191 Days, **`Frequency`**: 33.43, **`Monetary`**: ≈ 559  
  Customers in this group shop occasionally and have a moderate engagement level. **Personalized Offers** based on past shopping habits can encourage them to make more frequent purchases. Highlighting new arrivals or seasonal promotions can also help to maintain interest and increase engagement.

**High Activity Customers (Cluster 5)**  
  **RFM Values:** **`Recency`**: 9 Days, **`Frequency`**: 153.45, **`Monetary`**: ≈ 2,982  
  These customers are highly engaged and make frequent purchases. To keep them engaged, **Exclusive VIP Access** to sneak peeks or early access to new products or services is effective. Special offers like bundle deals or loyalty bonuses can also help maintain high engagement and reward their loyalty.

**Frequent Shoppers (Cluster 6)**  
  **RFM Values:** **`Recency`**: 36 Days, **`Frequency`**: 81.50, **`Monetary`**: ≈ 1,335  
  This segment consists of customers who purchase regularly but may not spend as much as high activity customers. **Loyalty and Upselling** should be the focus, with loyalty points for frequent shopping and cross-selling or upselling complementary products. Personalized recommendations can encourage repeat visits and keep them engaged.

**Top Spenders (Cluster 7)**  
  **RFM Values:** **`Recency`**: 4 Days, **`Frequency`**: 2,845.58, **`Monetary`**: ≈ 118,713  
  These customers are the highest spenders, showing the greatest value to the business. **High-Touch Concierge Service** is essential to maintain their loyalty. Offering exclusive, high-value offers, customized gifts, VIP events, or personalized loyalty programs can further incentivize continued spending.
