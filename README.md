# Customer Segmentation for Retail

## Project Overview

To effectively segment customers based on their purchasing behavior in order to gain insights into their preferences, thereby improving marketing strategies.

## Data Sources

This dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail

## Tools Used for this project

This analysis utilized the following Python libraries: 
- NumPy for numerical operations
-  Pandas for data processing
-  Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
-  Scikit-learn provides the algorithms for the clustering task and they includes: KMeans, DBSCAN, MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler, silhouette_score, TSNE, and PCA)

## Data Cleaning/Preparation

Missing values were detected and filled proportionally

## Analysis of Customer Segmentation 

### RFM Analysis

RFM Metrics Calculation:
- Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) metrics were calculated for each customer
- Recency was determined as the number of days since the customer's last purchase
- Frequency was calculated as the total number of purchases made by the customer
- Monetary value was calculated as the total amount spent by each customer

Data Normalization:
- To ensure that the clustering algorithm was not biased by features with different scales, the RFM metrics were normalized using Min-Max scaling. This scaled the data to a range between 0 and 1

### K-Means Clustering

- Customer Segmentation: K-Means clustering was applied to segment customers based on their RFM characteristics.
- Determining Optimal Number of Clusters: The optimal number of clusters (k) was determined using the Elbow Method and Silhouette analysis.
  - The Elbow Method identified the point of diminishing returns in the relationship between the number of clusters and the within-cluster sum of squares (inertia)
  - The Silhouette analysis evaluated the quality of cluster assignments by measuring how well each data point was assigned to its cluster compared to other clusters
- Cluster Assignment: Customers were assigned to clusters based on their similarity to other customers within the cluster


The approach above has effectively segmented customers based on their purchasing behavior, providing valuable insights for targeted marketing and customer relationship management strategies.


## Visualizations

### determining the Optimal Number of Clusters

- Elbow Method: A visual representation of the Elbow Method was generated by plotting the within-cluster sum of squares (inertia) against the number of clusters (k). The "elbow" point in the plot, where the rate of decrease in inertia begins to diminish significantly, indicates the optimal number of clusters.
- Silhouette Analysis: A plot of the Silhouette Score against the number of clusters was generated. Higher Silhouette Scores generally indicate better-defined and more distinct clusters.
